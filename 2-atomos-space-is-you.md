# Atomos Space Is You

Everyone working at Atomos Space represents Atomos Space. When a client or partner gets a response from William on support, William is Atomos Space. When a partner reads a tweet by Vanessa that we've made a big breakthrough, Vanessa is Atomos Space. In those situations, all the other stuff we do to cultivate our best image is secondary. What’s right in front of someone in a time of interest or need is what they’ll remember.

That’s what we mean when we say product is everyone’s responsibility, and that it pays to spend the time to recognize that. This means avoiding the [bullshit of outage language](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1528-the-bullshit-of-outage-language) and  [bending our policies, not just lending your ears](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3513-when-empathy-becomes-insulting). It means taking the time to get the writing right and consider how you’d feel if you were on the other side of the interaction.

It also means that you’re strongly encouraged to help share your thoughts, experiences, and learnings on [ORG BLOG NAME HERE](https://atomosspace.com/blog), our blog. The vast majority of our clients come to us because we are truly leaders in Space Transit. Our audience features the globe's brightest and best in aerospace, and your voice is part of us now, whether you like it or not! Tell us and our audience what you have to say!

This goes for tools and techniques as much as it goes for prose. Atomos Space not only tries to out-teach the competition, but also out-share and out-collaborate.

It's also worth noting that joining Atomos Space can be all-consuming. You dig Atomos Space, so you feel pressure to contribute, maybe overwhelmingly so. The people who work here are the best and brightest in our industry, so the self-imposed burden to be exceptional is real. But here's the thing: STOP IT. Settle in. We're glad you love this job because we all do too, but at the end of the day it's a job. Do your best work, collaborate with your team, write, read, learn, and then turn off your computer and play with your dog. We'll all be better for it.
