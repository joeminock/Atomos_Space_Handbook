its business strategy, future plans, financial information, contracts,

business of the Company and disclosing it only when authorized to do so
and to those who have a legitimate business need to know about it. This
duty of confidentiality applies whether the employee is on or off the
Company's premises, and during and even after the end of the employee's
employment with the Company. This duty of confidentiality also applies
to communications transmitted by the Company's electronic
communications. See also Internet, Email and Computer Use policy, herein.

As a condition of employment with the Company, all employees must sign a
Non-Disclosure Agreement.
