# Standards of Conduct and Employee Performance

## Anti- Harassment and Discrimination

The Company is committed to providing a work environment free of sexual
or any form of unlawful harassment or discrimination. Harassment or
unlawful discrimination against individuals on the basis of race,
religion, creed, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, sexual
orientation, gender identity, age, ancestry, physical or mental
disability, genetic information, marital status or any other
classification protected by local, state or federal laws is illegal and
prohibited by Company policy. Such conduct by or towards any employee,
contract worker, customer, vendor or anyone else who does business with
the Company will not be tolerated. Any employee or contract worker who
violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and
including termination of his or her employment or engagement. To the
extent a customer, vendor or other person with whom the Company does
business engages in unlawful harassment or discrimination, the Company
will take appropriate corrective action.

### Prohibited Conduct:

Prohibited harassment or discrimination includes any verbal, physical or visual conduct based on sex, race, age, national origin, disability
or any other legally protected basis if:

1. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an
individual's employment or engagement;
2. submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for decisions
concerning that individual's employment or engagement; or
3. it creates a hostile or offensive work environment.

Prohibited harassment includes (but is not limited to) unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors and lewd, vulgar or obscene
remarks, jokes, posters or cartoons, and any unwelcome touching,
pinching or other physical contact. Other forms of unlawful harassment
or discrimination may include racial epithets, slurs and derogatory
remarks, stereotypes, jokes, posters or cartoons based on race,
national origin, age, disability, marital status or other legally
protected categories. Prohibited harassment might also be transmitted
using the Company's
electronic communications system, or through other on-line conduct.

### Complaint Procedure:

Employees or contract workers who feel that they have been harassed or
discriminated against, or who witness any harassment or discrimination
by an employee, contract worker, customer, vendor or anyone else who
does business with the Company, should immediately report such conduct
to their supervisor or any other member of management.

Do not allow an inappropriate situation to continue by not reporting
it, regardless of who is creating the situation. No employee, contract
worker, customer, vendor or other person who does business with this
organization is exempt from the prohibitions in this policy. In
response to every complaint, the Company will conduct an investigation
which may involve interviewing witnesses if warranted and, if improper
conduct is found, take appropriate corrective action.

To the extent that an employee or contract worker is not satisfied with
the Company's handling of a harassment or discrimination complaint, he
or she may also contact the appropriate state or federal enforcement agency for legal relief.

## Attendance

Punctuality and regular attendance are essential to the successful
operation of the Company's business. If an employee is unable to report
to work (or to report to work on time) for any reason, the employee
must notify his or her supervisor before his or her starting time. If
an employee desires to leave work for any reason during the workday,
the employee must obtain the approval of his or her supervisor prior to
leaving. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness may subject the employee to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

## Discipline and Standards of Conduct

As an at-will employer, the Company may impose discipline whenever it
determines it is necessary or appropriate. Discipline may take various
forms, including verbal counseling, written warnings, suspension,
demotion, transfer, reassignment or termination. The discipline imposed
will depend on the circumstances of each case; therefore, discipline
will not necessarily be imposed in any particular sequence. Moreover,
at any time the Company determines it is appropriate, an
employee may be terminated immediately.

Every organization must have certain standards of conduct to guide the
behavior of employees. Although there is no possible way to identify
every rule of conduct, the following is an illustrative list (not
intended to be comprehensive or to limit the Company's right to impose
discipline for any other conduct it deems inappropriate). Keep in mind
that these standards of conduct apply to all employees whenever they
are on Company property and/or conducting Company business (on or off
Company property). Engaging in any conduct the Company deems
inappropriate may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.


1. Dishonesty;
2. Falsification of Company records;
3. Unauthorized use or possession of property that belongs to the Company, a coworker, or
of the public;
4. Possession or control of illegal drugs, weapons, explosives, or other dangerous or
unauthorized materials;
5. Fighting, engaging in threats of violence or violence, use of vulgar or abusive language,
horseplay, practical jokes or other disorderly conduct that may endanger others or
damage property;
6. Insubordination, failure to perform assigned duties or failure to comply with the Company's
health, safety or other rules;
7. Unauthorized or careless use of the Company's materials, equipment or property;
8. Unauthorized and/or excessive absenteeism or tardiness;
9. Lack of teamwork, poor communication, unsatisfactory performance, unprofessional
conduct, or conduct improper for the workplace;
10. Sexual or other illegal harassment or discrimination;
11. Unauthorized use or disclosure of the Company's confidential information;
12. Violation of any Company policy.


## Dress Code

What we wear to work is a reflection of the pride we have in our
Company, in what we do, and in ourselves. Although dress code
requirements will vary according to job responsibilities, we ask that
your appearance at all times show discretion, good taste, and
appropriateness for the safe performance of your job.

## Safety

The Company is committed to providing a safe workplace. Accordingly,
the Company emphasizes "safety first." It is the employee's
responsibility to take steps to promote safety in the workplace and
work in a safe manner. By remaining safety conscious, employees can
protect themselves and their coworkers. Employees are expected to
promptly report all unsafe working conditions, accidents and injuries,
regardless of how minor so that any potential hazards can be corrected.

## Substance and Abuse

The Company is committed to providing its employees with a safe and
productive work environment. In keeping with this commitment, it
maintains a strict policy against the use of alcohol
and the unlawful use of drugs in the workplace. Consequently, no
employee may consume or possess alcohol, or use, possess, sell,
purchase or transfer illegal drugs at any time while on the

Company's premises or while using the Company vehicles or equipment, or
at any location during work time.

No employee may report to work with illegal drugs (or their
metabolites) or alcohol in his or her bodily system. The only exception
to this rule is that employees may engage in moderate consumption of
alcohol that may be served and/or consumed as part of an authorized
Company social or business event. "Illegal drug" means any drug that is
not legally obtainable or that is legally obtainable but has not been
legally obtained. It includes prescription drugs not being used for
prescribed purposes or by the person to whom it is prescribed or in
prescribed amounts. It also includes any substance a person holds out
to another as an illegal drug.

Any violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to
and including termination.

Any employee who feels he or she has developed an addiction to,
dependence upon, or problem with alcohol or drugs, legal or illegal, is
strongly encouraged to seek assistance before a violation of this
policy occurs. Any employee who requests time off to participate in a
rehabilitation program will be reasonably accommodated. However,
employees may not avoid disciplinary action, up to and including
termination, by entering a rehabilitation program after a violation of
this policy is suspected or discovered.

## Workplace Searches

All offices, desks, file drawers, cabinets, lockers, Company vehicles,
and other Company equipment (including but not limited to computers, e
mail and voice mail) and facilities or any area on Company premises are
the property of the Company ("Company Property"), and are intended
for business use. Employees should have no expectation of privacy with
respect to Company property and/or items stored within Company Property
or on Company premises. Inspection may be conducted at any time,
without notice, at the discretion of the Company.

In addition, when the Company deems appropriate, employees may be
required to submit to searches of their personal vehicles, parcels,
purses, handbags, backpacks, brief cases, lunch boxes or any other
possessions or articles brought on to the Company's premises.

Persons entering the premises who refuse to cooperate in an inspection
conducted pursuant to this policy may not be permitted to enter the
premises. All employees must cooperate in an inspection; failure to do
so is insubordination and will result in disciplinary action, up to and 
including termination.
