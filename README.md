# Atomos Space Employee Handbook

As a relatively young company, it's quite rare to have a handbook. We felt it important however to document the things that we believe critical to our collective success. In the early days, most young companies expect their team members to figure things out for themselves. We're different. We don't believe the “throw them to the sharks” style works. It can be unnerving to join any company, but perhaps Atomos Space in particular, given our mission and the amazing team we're so fortunate to have. This handbook is designed to help you navigate your path with confidence and clarity.

This is where we’ll try to share what’s worth knowing about Atomos Space the company, our culture, our process, and our history. It’s a guide to understanding what people are talking about when they call for “Booster Team” (Admitting that they're stuck on a complex problem and need help), whether it’s okay to take your vacation when you’ve only been with us for a month (yes), what an meet-up is and why we call it an eat-up (hint: food… lots of food), and hopefully everything in-between.

This handbook also offers us an opportunity to clarify who we actually are as a company. What do we stand for? How should we work? Codifying those beliefs into a handbook makes them tangible and, most importantly, *editable*. Making the company our best product is a guiding principle, but we can’t easily improve what we haven’t articulated. So whatever version of this handbook you’re reading, you can be sure it’s not the last. Please do help keep it up to date! And by up to date, we're not just talking about misspellings and team changes. It’s just as much “we say we’re about X, but what we’re really doing is Y”. So many of these employee handbook projects turn out to be ideal-case prescriptions rather than real-world descriptions. They cover all the ways people should act, not the ways they actually do. That’s a sham. Let’s not write a handbook like that. Let’s keep it honest.

If you’re reading this just after joining the company, it’s particularly on you, actually. It’s harder for us slowly-boiled frogs who’ve been with Atomos Space for a while to spot the broken ways. Please take advantage of that glorious, shiny opportunity of being new, and question things.
