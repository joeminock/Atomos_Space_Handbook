## Atomos Space

### Orbit raising and precision asset placement
Atomos solves the last-mile problem in space by providing an in-space transportation service that lowers launch costs for satellite operators.

Atomos changes the rocket equation by adding a second logistics step to satellite launch. Space tugs reside in orbit so that last mile services--orbit raising, precision insertion, phasing, and plane changesâ€”can be accomplished rapidly and cost-effectively.
