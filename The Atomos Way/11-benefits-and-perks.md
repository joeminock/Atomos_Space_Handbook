Atomos Space recognizes, too, that your mental health is just as important as your physical health. Consider taking a mental health day every now and again when you're feeling overwhelmed or mentally fatigued. If a day or two won't cut it, we'll work with you to find a way to reduce the burden of your work at Atomos Space on your overall mental health. We really do want your work at Atomos Space to be the best work you do in your life, and we appreciate that that's not possible if you're uncertain about your health.
