# Who Does What?

Figuring out who to bring a particular issue or question to shouldn’t be a guessing game. Most concerns fall pretty clearly within the responsibility of a specific team at Atomos Space, and the head of that team should be the first point of contact. At the same time, every single person who works at Atomos Space is approachable and friendly, more than willing to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, you're probably not the first, so speak up!
