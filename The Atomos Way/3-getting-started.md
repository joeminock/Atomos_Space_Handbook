# Getting Started

## Expectations
Getting started at Atomos Space can be overwhelming. There are a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, you're learning a new job and new coworkers, and sometimes, you may be doing all these things while working independently or potentially remotely. Your Atomos Space buddy, your Ops buddy, and your manager are all here to help. If you don't know how to set up your machine (or *why* you're setting up something on your machine!), please ask. There is no set time period for most training periods, but most people are up to speed in about 3 months.

## Your Buddy
When you start, you'll be assigned a buddy. They'll introduce themselves and they're here to point you in the right direction when you need it. Of course, everyone is available to help, but it's nice to have a dedicated best work friend.

## Setting Up Your Machine, Accounts, and Getting Integrated with Systems
Your buddy helps you with day-to-day questions you might have, but you will end up setting up all the accounts you need to work at Atomos Space. Before you start, we will order you a new laptop with the specs required to do your job and any accessories you need, like an external keyboard, mouse, or monitor. We'll also set up an task list dedicated to your on-boarding. When you start, you'll have access to that resource in Wrike. In it, you'll see to-dos linking to accounts or services that you need to set up -- 2FA for various accounts and private wi-fi to name a few. You'll also see things that your Ops buddy or manager need to set up -- Slack, GitHub, Aws GovCloud among a whole list of other things. Don't worry if you don't know what some of these services are. Your Atomos Space buddy can help you through it.

If you have a specific training schedule or training milestones to complete, that will go into your Wrike Space too.
