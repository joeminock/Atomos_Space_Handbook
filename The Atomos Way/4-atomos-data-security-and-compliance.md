# Data Security and Compliance

At Atomos Space, security is our greatest priority. We're incredibly proud of the work we do, we're honored to be able to do it, and we both want and need to protect it. As our work is sensitive in nature, we need to do our best to ensure that we are the only people with access to it. Further, the nature of our work requires that we conform to the requirements of certain Federal Laws and International Treaties. Collectively, through our commitment to process, we can maintain compliance and ensure that our hard work stays secure.

## Password Policy

* Passwords must be created by LastPass and kept in either the Team Vault or your Personal Vault inside the team vault.
* Passwords must use at least three of the four available character types: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* Passwords must be a minimum of 12 characters.
* Passwords must be changed every 30 days.
* Old Passwords may not be reused.

## Data Security, Federal Law, and International Treaty Considerations

Atomos Space is developing the next generation of aerospace technology with empowers dramatic efficiency and cost savings for our clients as such, our work falls under the scope of Export Controlled Research.

Export Controlled Research includes information that is regulated for reasons of national security, foreign policy, anti-terrorism, or non-proliferation. The *International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)* and *Export Administration Regulations (EAR)* govern this data type. Current law requires that this data be stored in the U.S and that only authorized U.S. persons be allowed access to it.

The aforementioned Export Controls are federal laws and international treaties that govern how technology, technical data, technical assistance, and items or materials (from software to satellites and more) are physically or electronically exported, shipped, transmitted, transferred, or shared from the U.S. to foreign countries, persons, or entities.

Protecting sensitive data is a shared responsibility. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of permitted services complies with Atomos policies as well as federal policies and international laws where applicable.

### Data Types Included in EAR and ITAR Scope
* **Data at Rest** (Laptops, desktops, USB Devices, Offsite Backup, Databases, etc.)
* **Data in Motion** (Emails, File Transfers, Web Traffic, etc.)
* **Data in Use** (SharePoint, Private Cloud, File & Application Servers, Database, etc.)

### Working with Export-Controlled Data

#### Access Controls
* Do not access export-controlled information from shared, public computers such as kiosk-type computers in libraries, hotels, and business centers, or from computers that have no local access control.

* Do not post export-controlled information on public websites or websites that rely solely on IP addresses for access control.

* Protect export-controlled information by at least one physical and one logical barrier (e.g. locked container or room and login and password) when not under direct individual control.

#### Transmission of ITAR covered data
* Do not transmit or email Controlled Information unencrypted. An alternative to email is to put the files in a secure location (e.g. AWS GovCloud) and send an authenticated link in a message to whomever needs access to the file.

* Wireless network access to Controlled Information must be encrypted using, e.g., WPA2 Enterprise wireless network encryption and/or VPN.

* Do not transmit data over a non-Atomos, open, community, coffee shop, or library wi-fi network without the use of a VPN.

* Do not transmit or discuss in detail, sensitive data via Slack.

#### Laptop Security
* Data must be stored on a Atomos Space-owned and managed single-user laptop device using whole disk encryption (e.g. FileVault2 for Mac, BitLocker for Windows, LUKS for Linux) with a unique decryption passphrase known only to the device's authorized primary user.
* Laptop access must be limited to ONLY the designated user and authentication via secure password and/or biological authentication.
* If traveling internationally, review our [International Travel Guide](https://github.com/joeminock/Atomos_Space_Handbook/blob/master/international-travel-guide.md) well in advance of your trip.

#### Storing ITAR covered data
Export-controlled data is stored only on devices provided to you by Atomos Space and in accordance with this policy.

If the export-controlled data cannot be encrypted at rest using an electronic barrier, a physical barrier must be implemented (e.g. locked rack, storage safe, etc.).

### Permitted Storage Resources

*Amazon Web Services - Government Cloud*
AWS-GovCloud provides variety of cloud-based infrastructure services (storage, database, computing) and is physically located in the United States and is staffed by U.S. persons, which makes it compliant with Export Control regulations such as ITAR and EAR.

### Traveling with Export-Controlled Data
As much of the work we do at Atomos Space can be classified as Export-Controlled Data, it is critical to our business, national security, and your personal liberties that any Travel be undertaken with consideration for the security of our data.

Should you need to travel internationally for work, please engage your manager or leadership to form an appropriate strategy that provides you access to the data you need while maintaining compliance with any governing policy or laws.
