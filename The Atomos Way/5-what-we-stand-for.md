# What We Stand For

## Values

Before anything else, values come first. Without clear, shared values, we wander independently and contradict one another. Everything's harder when we all believe different things about what's important to *us*, our company.

#### Key values:

### **Total Individual Accountability.**
Bureaucracy and processes are created to protect companies from mediocre engineers. We are not mediocre engineers. We take total ownership of everything that we do, including checking our blind spots.

### **Self-Aware.**
Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Acknowledge and communicate yours. Work on making them better, or work out who is better suited for something that you are weak at. Be open to receiving feedback and evaluating it for merit.

### **Question Convention and Understand Assumptions.**.
Details to be added :-)
