# Our Internal Systems

These are the internal systems that help us support, report, and operate the company. They are as follows:

### Slack

Our central point of communication. This is where we check in for virtual standups, kibitz about ideas, ask for or give help, or share the latest funny comic on Ikcd (https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/how_hacking_works.png)

*Please do not share or discuss sensitive project data on Slack*

### WRIKE

Wrike is our project management application. It's where we keep track of whats to be done and hold each other accountable.

### Github

This is our team private repository of documents and code that does not fall under EAR or ITAR compliance requirements. It allows us to keep track of document, file, and application versions. This very document resides in our Github repo.

### Gusto
