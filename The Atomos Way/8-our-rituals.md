# Our Rituals

## Slack Stand-ups

Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, the Stand-Up channel Slackbot will ping you with 3 questions:
1. What did you accomplish yesterday?
2. What are you working on today?
3. What obstacles do you have right now?

It's really important that we all participate in these quick check-ins as it helps each of us keep a pulse on what's up.

## Team Outs

Our sense of community and culture is just as important as the work we do. As a team, there will be times where we need to step away and take a break together. This could be a quick walk, a team lunch, or a visit to Elitch Gardens.  

## Team Building Off-Sites or Retreats

Our collective health is of the utmost importance. Every once in a while, we'll schedule an afternoon, weekend day, or team trip for the express purpose of building our strengths as a team and having fun together. Talk about work is expressly forbidden as this is a great time for us to bond and get to know each other on a different level. These are never mandatory and your significant others are welcome to join in the fun.
