#Employment-At-Will

Employment with the Company is on an at-will basis, unless otherwise
specified in a written employment agreement. You are free to resign at
any time, for any reason, with or without notice. Similarly, the Company
is free to conclude the employment relationship at any time for any
lawful reason, with or without cause, and with or without notice.

Nothing in this Handbook will limit the right of either party to
terminate an at-will employment. No section of this Handbook is meant to
be construed, nor should be construed, as establishing anything other
than an employment-at-will relationship. This Handbook does not limit
management's discretion to make personnel decisions such as
reassignment, change of wages and benefits, demotion, etc. No person
other than the CEO, President, or COO has the authority to enter into an
agreement for employment for any specified period of time or to make an
agreement for employment other than at-will terms. Only the CEO,
President, or COO of the Company has the authority to make any such
agreement, which is only binding if it is in writing and signed by the President of the Company.
