# Data Security, ITAR and EAR Compliance

Export Controlled Research includes information that is regulated for reasons of national security, foreign policy, anti-terrorism, or non-proliferation. The *International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)* and *Export Administration Regulations (EAR)* govern this data type. Current law requires that this data be stored in the U.S and that only authorized U.S. persons be allowed access to it.

Export Controls are federal laws that govern how technology, technical data, technical assistance, and items or materials (from software to satellites and more) are physically or electronically exported, shipped, transmitted, transferred, or shared from the U.S. to foreign countries, persons, or entities.

As Atomos Space is developing technology which is sensitive to the interests of the global aerospace community, we are required by law to conform with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

If you are in an engineering role, you must follow Atomos process and best practices to ensure our collective compliance. Failing to do so risks access to our development and is in breach of Federal Law.
