# Dog Friendly Workplace

Collectively, we agree that dogs are awesome, but having them in the office is a privilege, and with privilege comes responsibility.

## Dog Policy
team members are 100% responsible, 100% of the time, for their dog’s wellbeing, behavior, and biological needs, including: scooping, bagging, cleaning, and sanitizing as needed.

Team members shall be respectfully attentive to coworkers who may be uncomfortable or distracted by the dog’s behavior and proactively address distractions as well as be open to co-workers suggestions on how to improve distractions.

#### All Dogs MUST be:
* Dogs must be at least 12 months old.
* Owned and housed by team member for at least 30 days
* Current on vaccinations including DDTP and Rabies, at all times
* Parasite-free (fleas, ticks, etc.)
* Spayed or neutered
* Obedient
* Potty trained and of good hygiene (e.g., no foul, unpleasant or strong odors).
* Positively attended to 100% of the time
* Covered under the owner’s homeowner’s/renter’s insurance, which must cover dog bites and have no breed exclusions.
* Team members must clean up after their dog goes to the bathroom outside.
* Waste should be disposed of properly in a trash receptacle outside.

#### NO dog shall:
* Exhibit aggressive behavior
* Be disruptive to co-workers, and/or inhibit work productivity
* Bark excessively

### Dog Calendar
We have started a Dog Calendar (on Office 360) where team members may schedule a day to bring their dog to work. This allows team members to plan so that the office will have a maximum of 3 dogs in the office at a time, and helps keep the dog party to a low roar.
