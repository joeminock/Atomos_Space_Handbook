"Do I need a visa?"

"What do I say to the customs officer?"

"Can I bring my work laptop with me?"

If you travel out of the country for business purposes—to a company meetup or a professional conference—or even on a family vacation with your work laptop, you're facing up to questions about business visitor visas, customs, and border security.

We have answers!

### When you travel for Atomos Space business, here's what you may need:

1. A passport! Apply for one now if you don't have one already. Renew now if your passport expires in the next six months.
2. A travel visa or waiver.
3. An invitation letter that substantiates the purpose of your travel.
4. Your hotel address and contact info.
5. A security checklist for your laptop and phone. **Clearing work data from your devices is *REQUIRED* before crossing the border.**

## Visa

You may need a visa (or a waiver!) to authorize travel to the destination country. Please be sure to research the type of Visa or Waiver that you may need for travel.

## Company Security at the Border

When you enter any destination country or return to the US, you may be asked to unlock your phone or laptop for search, possibly exposing sensitive company data like source code, passwords, and customer account data. Yikes! We need to take some precautionary measures to safeguard our data.

(What's a work device? Anything you have company data on: your laptop where you work with Atomos Space source code or designs; your tablet where you read Atomos Space email; your phone where you use the Atomos Space app; etc.)

### TL;DR: Do NOT Travel With Work Data

* If you don't need your work laptop (or tablet/phone), don't bring it with you!
* Wipe company data from your phone before crossing the border. Restore it afterward.

## Checklist: Before You Travel

* Let us know! Share your travel plans and when you expect to arrive in the destination country.
* Ensure you have your passport, travel waivers or Visa, invitation letter (if applicable), and travel details all in order.
* Put William and our attorney on speed dial.
  * If you run into general travel issues or have any questions, contact William Kowalski.
  * If you're detained or encounter some other serious customs headache, contact our attorney directly: [Attorney TBA] (get phone number from William). Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is not required to allow you to contact an attorney, but [Attorney TBA] is your first call if possible.
* 1Password
  * Check that your personal 1Password vault doesn't have any work logins. If it does, move them to the Atomos Space team vault instead. You have a personal vault inside the Atomos Space team which is perfect for those logins.
  * Turn on Travel Mode. Go to https://AtomosSpace.1password.com/profile and click Enable Travel Mode.
  * Open 1Password on each device you're traveling with (laptop, phone, iPad, etc) so it can wipe its data while it's in Travel Mode.
