# Where We Work

## Office

The Atomos Space HQ is in Denver, in the Galvanize Platte location, jsut a stones throw from downtown. Four people and one dog have desk space in the office, but those people also work from home regularly. We moved into the office in May 2019, and before that, we shared space with our friends in the Techstars Boulder accelerator space.

Anyone is welcome to visit Denver and work from the office at any time.

## From home

Working from home is always an option. Doing so just requires that you're working on a secure network and accessing Atomos Space resources via VPN. 

## From coffee shops

Working from home all the time isn't everyone's cup of coffee. Thus, lots of us choose to work from coffee shops or other third spaces either some of the time or a lot of the time. Great for a buzz of other people and much-needed [caffeine](https://giphy.com/gifs/bobs-burgers-fox-bobs-burgers-tv-3o72F3CQSLwU7XTlDy) of course, but please do mind our [basic security rules](https://3.Atomos Space.com/2914079/buckets/34/documents/14419) and procedures to ensure that nothing leaks on to the cafe wifi.

## From a coworking space

If working from home or from a coffee shop doesn't suit you, then trying a coworking space might just do the trick. Atomos Space offers a $200/month stipend towards a desk in such a place.
